## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Thanks to this exercise, I have consolidated the use of basic CSS properties, as well as familiarized myself with the use of variables in CSS in more detail.

Here's an example of using a variable:

```css
:root {
  /* Some code... */

  --font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;

  --body-font-size: 15px;
  --heading-font-size: 22px;

  /* Some other code... */
}

body {
  /* Some code... */

  font-family: var(--font-family);
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: var(--body-font-size);

  /* Some other code... */
}
```

### Continued development

I think I should continue to study CSS in more depth, as I think I still don't know it very well
